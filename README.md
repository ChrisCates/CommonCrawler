### Notice in regards to development

Currently I do not have the capacity to hire full time, however, I do have the intention of hiring someone to help build infrastructure related to CommonCrawl. All Gitcoin bounties are currently on hold. When I do have time to further invest in this project, will discuss full time devops developer to work on said project. All payment will be done in DAI and resource allocation will be approximately 5k/mo.

## As a GUI

An electron based interface that works with a Go server will be available.

## As a library

Install as a dependency:

```bash
go get https://github.com/ChrisCates/CommonCrawler
```

Access the library functions by `import`ing it:

```golang
import(
  cc "github.com/ChrisCates/CommonCrawler"
)

func main() {
  cc.scan()
  cc.download()
  cc.extract()
  // And so forth
}
```

## As a command line tool

Install from source:

```bash
go install  https://github.com/ChrisCates/CommonCrawler
```

Or you can curl from Github:

```bash
curl https://github.com/ChrisCates/CommonCrawler/raw/master/dist/commoncrawler -o commoncrawler
```

Then run as a binary:

```bash
# Output help
commoncrawler --help

# Specify configuration
commoncrawler --base-uri https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/
commoncrawler --wet-paths wet.paths
commoncrawler --data-folder output/crawl-data
commoncrawler --start 0
commoncrawler --stop 5 # -1 will loop through all wet files from wet.paths

# Start crawling the web
commoncrawler start --stop -1
```

## Compilation and Configuration

### Installing dependencies

```bash
go get github.com/logrusorgru/aurora
```

### Downloading data with the application

First configure the type of data you want to extract.

```golang
// Config is the preset variables for your extractor
type Config struct {
    baseURI     string
    wetPaths    string
    dataFolder  string
    matchFolder string
    start       int
    stop        int
}

//Defaults
Config{
    start:       0,
    stop:        5,
    baseURI:     "https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/",
    wetPaths:    path.Join(cwd, "wet.paths"),
    dataFolder:  path.Join(cwd, "/output/crawl-data"),
    matchFolder: path.Join(cwd, "/output/match-data"),
}
```

### With Docker

```bash
docker build -t commoncrawler .
docker run commoncrawler
```

### Without Docker

```bash
go build -i -o ./dist/commoncrawler ./src/*.go
./dist/commoncrawler
```

Or you can run simply just run it.

```bash
go run src/*.go
```
